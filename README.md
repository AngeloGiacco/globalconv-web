# getconversational.ai

our goals are:
1. make it easy to create multilingual agents that integrate with your existing localisation framework
2. make it easy to run analytics over conversations with multilingual agents (e.g: agents whose conversations will be in languages you don't understand)

Creating a new agent can be done via web app or command line and is as easy as:
1. defining base language that it is specified in
2. defining a first message, system prompt, llm provider
3. defining which languages to translate to
4. defining default language (does not have to be spec language) which is defaulted to english unless otherwise specified
5. embedding the provided html component in your website!
